        "description": "The Oaks course, at 7,044 yards from the back tees, offers a test for golfers of all skill levels. It's towering oak trees frame the fairways, along with large undulating greens that average more than 4,500 square feet of surface area, huge greenside bunkers, and generous fairways. The par-4, 18th hole that borders Lake Harrison adds to the natural beauty and challenge of the Oaks course. Originally designed by Joe Lee and Robert von Hagge in 1975, the Oaks course was redesigned by Jay Morrish & Associates in 1999. Jay Morrish is known as a studious and intelligent designer, having studied under Robert Trent Jones, Sr. and George Fazio. After spending 10 years working with Jack Nicklaus at Nicklaus Design, Morrish left in 1983 and partnered with former PGA Tour Player Tom Weiskopf. Morrish was named \u201cArchitect of the Year\u201d by Golf World magazine in 1996 and continues to design championship courses with his son Carter.",
